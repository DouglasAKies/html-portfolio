<h1>The Best Movies According to Angela</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
        <h3>Interstellar</h3>
            <p>Instellar is an encapsulating movie that immerses you in an outer world experience while creating a mind-bending finish.</p>
        <h3>Avatar</h3>
            <p>As a kid, this movie stood out to me with its level of adventure, wonder, and thrill. I mean who didn't think becoming Na'vi would be an incredible experience. </p>
        <h3>Coco</h3>
            <p>A story of family, adventure, and Mexican culture. This animation is no movie just for kids. It's an opportunity to experience Dia de Los Muertos in both the Living and Spirit worlds.</p>
